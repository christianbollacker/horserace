      <h3>How to play</h3>
      <p>We have a classic three way race between some great horses from different eras.  Each horse has strengths and weaknesses.  One horse may have the fastest top end speed and get off the line to quick start, but lack the endurance to keep that pace up for the entire run.  Another horse may not be as fast, but can sustain his speed throughout the race.  It is up to you to decide which factors are more important to you when picking your pony.  Choose your pony by clicking the pick me button.</br>  When you are ready click the 'Start the Race!' button to begin.</p>

      <h3>About Race Day Mojo</h3>
      <p>If each horse ran the same way each time the results would be very predictable. As we know, in horse racing nothing is guaranteed.  Check the <a href="https://github.com/christianbollacker/horserace">code</a> to see if you can determine what gives each horse their race day mojo and drives them to run a little harder each time.</p>
